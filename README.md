Snippets is a small web application that can be used to track diary
entries on a weekly basis. By allowing users of this web application to
subscribe to others, they may receive weekly reports of all snippets
written that week. Work on this utility was inspired by
[an identically named tool in use at Google](https://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/a-simple-productivity-tip-from-googles-early-days.html).
